Cappuccino Applications in a couchdb

I have taken the sources from [Aaron Quint's Soca](https://github.com/quirkey/soca) and try to integrate them with the [Cappuccino Javascript Framework](http://cappuccino.org). 

Perhaps it will be possible to remerge these changes into the original Soca tool so that it can generate couchapps from different templates. For now I just want to try, whether it is possible at all to integrate couchdb and cappuccino.

In order to have Soca and my experimental tool on the same machine I renamed everything from Soca to Couchino.
